# How Are Issue Requests Handled?

Issue Request are handled in a few ways, namely:

- We use custom templates for GitHub Issues
  - [For Bug Reports](https://github.com/resist-js/resist/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
  - [For Feature Requests](https://github.com/resist-js/resist/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)
  - [For Documentation](https://github.com/resist-js/resist/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml)

[What are Issue Templates?](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)

When an Issue Request is created, it must conform to the policies set out in [Contributing](https://github.com/resist-js/resist/CONTRIBUTING.md).
