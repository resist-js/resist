# resist.js Charter

The resist.js project aims to build a fast and low overhead framework for svelte.

## Section 0: Guiding Principles

The resist.js project is part of the [OpenJS Foundation][openjs foundation]. It operates transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 1: Scope

resist.js is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a plugin architecture.

### 1.1: In-scope

- Develop a web framework for svelte with a focus on developer experience, performance and extensibility.
- Plugin Architecture
- Support web protocols
- Official plugins for common user requirements
- Documentation:
  - Project (policies, processes, and releases)
  - Guides and Tutorials
  - Framework API
  - Website
- Write easier APIs for developers
- Tools:
  - CI services
  - Bots to improve overall efficiency
  - Releases
- Support:
  - Community
  - Users's issues and questions
- Contributors's pull request review

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope

- Support versions of Node.js at EOL (end of life) stage
- Support serverless architecture
- Contributions that violates the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC

Technical leadership for the projects within the [OpenJS Foundation][openjs foundation] is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) (CPC). In the case of the resist.js project, it is delegated to the [Collaborators](README.md#team). The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the "Board").

This resist.js Charter reflects a carefully constructed balanced role for the Collaborators and the CPC in the governance of the OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the Collaborators to propose change using simple majority of the full Organization, the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the CPC. The CPC may additionally make amendments to the Collaborators charter at any time, though the CPC will not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings of the Organization.

### 2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships

Section Intentionally Left Blank

## Section 3: Governing Body

resist.js is governed by its [maintainers](README.md#team). See [how it is structured](GOVERNANCE.md) for more information.

## Section 4: Roles & Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of resist.jss's maintainers are described in [the project organization](GOVERNANCE.md).

### Section 4.1 Project Operations & Management

Section Intentionally Left Blank

### Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections

**Decision-making**

resist.js's features can be discussed in GitHub issues and/or projects.
Consensus on a discussion is reached when there is no objection by any
collaborators.

Whenever there is not consensus, Lead Maintainers will have final say on the topic.

**Voting, and/or Elections**

These processes are described in the [GOVERNANCE](GOVERNANCE.md) document.

### Section 4.3: Other Project Roles

Section Intentionally Left Blank

## Section 5: Definitions

- _Contributors_: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the project’s Collaborators to have code committed to the code base. Contributors should rarely be encumbered by the Collaborators and never by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.

- _Collaborators_: contribute code and other artifacts, have the right to commit to the code base and release plugins projects. Collaborators follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to manage the project. A Collaborator could be encumbered by other Collaborators and never by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.

- _Lead Maintainers_: founders of the project, contribute code and other artifacts, have the right to commit to the code base and release the project. Lead Maintainers follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to manage the project. A Lead Maintainer will be encumbered by the Collaborators and by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.
