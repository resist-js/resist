# How Are Commits Handled?

The Committing process is fairly straightforward, it is based on a few simple rules:

- When you make a commit, such as through `git commit`, or a UI based commit solution, the commit process is handled by `Commitizen`.
- The policies in [Contributing](https://github.com/resist-js/resist) are enforced.
