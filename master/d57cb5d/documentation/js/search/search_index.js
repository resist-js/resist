collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies. These resources help people who want to learn how to run and contribute to projects in an effective way. Contributors and people new to will find the following guides especially useful:\n\nHow to Contribute to Open Source\nBuilding Welcoming Communities\n\nGet involved\nThere are many ways to contribute to resist.js, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:\n\nSimply start using resist.js. Go through the Getting Started guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by opening an issue.\nLook through the open issues. A good starting point would be issues tagged good first issue. Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help triage issues.\nIf you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request.\nRead through our tutorials. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can make make a Pull Request.\nTake a look at the features requested by others in the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.\n\nContributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please ping us on Slack at https://resistjs.dev/chat and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.\nTriaging issues and pull requests\nOne great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.\n\nAsk for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.\nSuggest labels that can help categorize issues.\nFlag issues that are stale or that should be closed.\nAsk for test plans and review code.\n\nBugs\nWe use GitHub issues for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new unreported bug, you can submit a bug report.\nIf you have questions about using resist.js, contact us on Slack at https://resistjs.dev/chat, and we will do our best to answer your questions.\nIf you see anything you'd like to be implemented, create a feature request issue\nReporting new issues\nWhen opening a new issue, always make sure to fill out the issue template. This step is very important! Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.\n\nOne issue, one bug: Please report a single bug per issue.\nProvide reproduction steps: List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.\n\nRFCs\nIf you'd like to propose an implementation for a large new feature or change then please create an RFC to discuss it up front.\nDeveloping\nThis is a monorepo meaning the repo holds multiple packages. It requires the use of pnpm. You can install pnpm with:\nnpm i -g pnpmpnpm commands run in the project's root directory will run on all sub-projects. You can checkout the code and build all sub-projects with:\ngit clone git@github.com:resist-js/resist.git\ncd resist\npnpm i\npnpm buildPull requests\nYour first pull request\nSo you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:\nHow to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub\nProposing a change\nIf you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can also file an issue with feature template.\nIf you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend that you file an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.\nSending a pull request\nSmall pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.\nPlease make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:\n\nFork the repository and create your branch from master.\nDescribe your test plan in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes.\nMake sure your code lints (pnpm check).\nMake sure your tests pass (pnpm test).\n\nAll pull requests should be opened against the master branch.\nTest plan\nA good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output, provides screenshots or videos if the pull request changes UI.\n\nIf you've changed APIs, updated the documentation.\n\nTesting\nRun pnpm test to run the tests for all subpackages.\nYou can run the tests for a single package by first moving to that directory. E.g. cd packages/go.\nYou must rebuild each time before running the tests if you've made code changes.\nTo run a single integration test, provide the FILTER env var with the test name. E.g. FILTER=\"includes paths\" pnpm test:integration. You can also open up the file and change test to test.only.\nYou can run the test server with pnpm go to hit it with your browser.\nBreaking changes\nWhen adding a new breaking change, follow this template in your pull request:\n### New breaking change here\n\n- **Who does this affect**:\n- **How to migrate**:\n- **Why make this breaking change**:\n- **Severity (number of people affected x effort)**:What happens next?\nThe core resist.js team will be monitoring for pull requests. Do help us by making your pull request easy to review by following the guidelines above.\nStyle guide\nEslint will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running pnpm check.\nCoding style\nThere are a few guidelines we follow:\n\nInternal variables are written with snake_case while external APIs are written with camelCase\nProvide a single object as the argument to public APIs. This object can have multiple properties\nAvoid creating new test projects under packages/*/test/apps but reuse an existing one when possible\nEnsure pnpm check pass.\n\nGenerating changelogs\nFor changes to be reflected in package changelogs, run pnpx changeset and follow the prompts. All changesets should be patch until resist.js 1.0\nReleases\nThe Changesets GitHub action will create and update a PR that applies changesets and publishes new versions of changed packages to npm.\nNew packages will need to be published manually the first time if they are scoped to the @resistjs organisation, by running this from the package directory:\nnpm publish --access=publicLicense\nBy contributing to resist.js, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
