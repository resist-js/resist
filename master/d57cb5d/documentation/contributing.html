<p>Contributions are very welcome. If you think you need help planning your contribution, please ping us on Slack at <a href="https://resistjs.dev/chat">https://resistjs.dev/chat</a> and let us know you are looking for a bit of help.</p>
<h3 id="triaging-issues-and-pull-requests">Triaging issues and pull requests</h3>
<p>One great way you can contribute to the project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.</li>
<li>Suggest <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/labels">labels</a> that can help categorize issues.</li>
<li>Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.</li>
<li>Ask for test plans and review code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/issues">GitHub issues</a> for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new unreported bug, you can submit a <a href="#reporting-new-issues">bug report</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions about using resist.js, contact us on Slack at <a href="(https://resistjs.dev/chat">https://resistjs.dev/chat</a>, and we will do our best to answer your questions.</p>
<p>If you see anything you&#39;d like to be implemented, create a <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/issues/new?template=feature_request.md">feature request issue</a></p>
<h2 id="reporting-new-issues">Reporting new issues</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/issues/new/choose">opening a new issue</a>, always make sure to fill out the issue template. <strong>This step is very important!</strong> Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion. Don&#39;t take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you&#39;ve gathered all the information required by the template.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One issue, one bug:</strong> Please report a single bug per issue.</li>
<li><strong>Provide reproduction steps:</strong> List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rfcs">RFCs</h2>
<p>If you&#39;d like to propose an implementation for a large new feature or change then please <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/rfcs">create an RFC</a> to discuss it up front.</p>
<h2 id="developing">Developing</h2>
<p>This is a monorepo meaning the repo holds multiple packages. It requires the use of <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/en/">pnpm</a>. You can <a href="https://pnpm.io/installation">install pnpm</a> with:</p>
<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">npm i -g pnpm</code></pre></div><p><code>pnpm</code> commands run in the project&#39;s root directory will run on all sub-projects. You can checkout the code and build all sub-projects with:</p>
<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">git clone git&#64;github.com:resist-js/resist.git
cd resist
pnpm i
pnpm build</code></pre></div><h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>
<h3 id="your-first-pull-request">Your first pull request</h3>
<p>So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You&#39;ve invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.</p>
<p>Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:</p>
<p><a href="https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github"><strong>How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="proposing-a-change">Proposing a change</h3>
<p>If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can also file an issue with <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/issues/new?template=feature_request.md">feature template</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re only fixing a bug, it&#39;s fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend that you file an issue detailing what you&#39;re fixing. This is helpful in case we don&#39;t accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-pull-request">Sending a pull request</h3>
<p>Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.</p>
<p>Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/resist-js/resist/">the repository</a> and create your branch from <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>Describe your <strong>test plan</strong> in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes.</li>
<li>Make sure your code lints (<code>pnpm check</code>).</li>
<li>Make sure your tests pass (<code>pnpm test</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All pull requests should be opened against the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h4 id="test-plan">Test plan</h4>
<p>A good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output, provides screenshots or videos if the pull request changes UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;ve changed APIs, updated the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
<p>Run <code>pnpm test</code> to run the tests for all subpackages.</p>
<p>You can run the tests for a single package by first moving to that directory. E.g. <code>cd packages/go</code>.</p>
<p>You must rebuild each time before running the tests if you&#39;ve made code changes.</p>
<p>To run a single integration test, provide the <code>FILTER</code> env var with the test name. E.g. <code>FILTER=&quot;includes paths&quot; pnpm test:integration</code>. You can also open up the file and change <code>test</code> to <code>test.only</code>.</p>
<p>You can run the test server with <code>pnpm go</code> to hit it with your browser.</p>
<h4 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h4>
<p>When adding a new breaking change, follow this template in your pull request:</p>
<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-md">### New breaking change here

- **Who does this affect**:
- **How to migrate**:
- **Why make this breaking change**:
- **Severity (number of people affected x effort)**:</code></pre></div><h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h3>
<p>The core resist.js team will be monitoring for pull requests. Do help us by making your pull request easy to review by following the guidelines above.</p>
<h2 id="style-guide">Style guide</h2>
<p><a href="https://eslint.org">Eslint</a> will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status of your code styling by simply running <code>pnpm check</code>.</p>
<h3 id="coding-style">Coding style</h3>
<p>There are a few guidelines we follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal variables are written with <code>snake_case</code> while external APIs are written with <code>camelCase</code></li>
<li>Provide a single object as the argument to public APIs. This object can have multiple properties</li>
<li>Avoid creating new test projects under <code>packages/*/test/apps</code> but reuse an existing one when possible</li>
<li>Ensure <code>pnpm check</code> pass.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generating-changelogs">Generating changelogs</h3>
<p>For changes to be reflected in package changelogs, run <code>pnpx changeset</code> and follow the prompts. All changesets should be <code>patch</code> until resist.js 1.0</p>
<h3 id="releases">Releases</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/changesets/action#with-publishing">Changesets GitHub action</a> will create and update a PR that applies changesets and publishes new versions of changed packages to npm.</p>
<p>New packages will need to be published manually the first time if they are scoped to the <code>@resistjs</code> organisation, by running this from the package directory:</p>
<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">npm publish --access=public</code></pre></div><h2 id="license">License</h2>
