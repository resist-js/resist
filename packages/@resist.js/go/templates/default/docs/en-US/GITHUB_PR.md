# How Are Pull Requests Handled?

Pull Requests are handled in a few ways, namely:

- We use a custom template for GitHub Pull Requests
  - [See Here](~GITHUB_URL~blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

[What are Pull Request Templates?](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)

When a Pull Request is created, it must conform to the policies set out in [Contributing](~GITHUB_URL~CONTRIBUTING.md).
